# Python_stuff
Python repo containing examples, small scripts for certain purposes and small projects that may not be completed or even continued in other repos

This repository will only be updated once in a while when I have new examples for something new I've learned, I work on new projects/update existing ones, or write new scripts

Update log:

-(jan. 18th 2018) Added examples/playing_with_time_modules.py, which is a script to exemplify some of the objects and methods available in the datetime and calendar modules. For this, I've used the payment of a debt with a given interest rate as an example
