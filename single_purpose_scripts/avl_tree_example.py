'''
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It was the first such data
structure to be invented.
In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by one
or less. If, at any time, they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to
restore this property.
'''
'''
The balance factor of a node N is defined to be the height difference
	BalanceFactor(N) = Height(RightSubtree(N)) â€“ Height(LeftSubtree(N))
of its two child subtrees.
A binary tree is defined to be an AVL tree if the BalanceFactor of each node in
the tree is in the inclusive range of -1 to 1.
A node N with BalanceFactor < 0 is called "left-heavy", one with
BalanceFactor > 0 is called "right-heavy", and one with BalanceFactor = 0 is
sometimes simply called "balanced".
