The following decorators implement test skipping and expected failures:

@unittest.skip(reason)
    Unconditionally skip the decorated test. reason should describe why the test is being skipped.

@unittest.skipIf(condition, reason)
    Skip the decorated test if condition is true.

@unittest.skipUnless(condition, reason)
    Skip the decorated test unless condition is true.

@unittest.expectedFailure
    Mark the test as an expected failure. If the test fails when run, the test is not counted as a failure.

exception unittest.SkipTest(reason)
    This exception is raised to skip a test.
    Usually you can use TestCase.skipTest() or one of the skipping decorators instead of raising this directly.
